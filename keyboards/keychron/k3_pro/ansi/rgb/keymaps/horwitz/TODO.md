* `TO()` vs. `TG()`
* what exactly _is_ the color returned by `rgb_matrix_get_hsv()`? is this some overall color (as opposed to per-key ones)?
* `uint16_t` vs. `int` \(etc.\)
* make any use of `(RGB|HSV)_(AZURE|BLUE|...)` from `color.h`?
* \(?\)reorganize code by feature \(as much as possible/sensible\) and simplify comments \(as much as possible\)
* `process_record_user` vs. `rgb_matrix_indicators_(advanced_)user`
